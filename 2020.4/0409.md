​	Alembics were invented at sony, and the whole point of developing it is to have a data type that can be used across multiple platforms like Maya max houdini xsi and so on, unlike fbx it doesnt bake the animation keys on rigged geometry on each frame, which I guess was heavy to load and unload, but in alembics it bakes the animation on points and then you need a static geometry on single frame and transfer the animation point data on to it which is much lighter

this way scenes are lighter and all you keep is just necessary information to process and hence faster processing and better render times
